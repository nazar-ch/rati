# Research — open directions

Everything here is **not implemented**. It is design space: forward-looking directions, each
waiting for a real (Jnana- or consumer-driven) need so the shape is pinned by a concrete use
case. If a direction ships, its record moves to [../archive/](../archive/); if it's actively
being executed, it becomes a [../planned/](../planned/) effort. Anything that stays here is,
by construction, not yet in the code.

This is the flattened successor of the `directions-2026-07/` design review — the review's
**shipped** documents (naming renames, the data package, selective refresh + SSR sources, the
SSR server kit + nazar-pattern absorption) now live in
[../archive/directions-2026-07/](../archive/directions-2026-07/); its still-open options were
regrouped by topic into the files below.

## Topics

- [scope-and-island-directions.md](./scope-and-island-directions.md) — abort signals for data
  loads; advanced island loading states (`loadingDelayMs`, `keepStale` + status hook, retry
  policy, per-island `ssr: false`, SSR-error dehydration options); `ResourceContainer` migrating
  into core for shared resource lifetimes.
- [router-extensions.md](./router-extensions.md) — `group`/`include` composition, nested wrapper
  stacks, layout-level scope, namespaced names, typed path converters, route guards, regex paths;
  plus typed search params and navigation status/blocking.
- [stores-and-router.md](./stores-and-router.md) — the stores-container pattern assessment: what
  it buys, the router-induced dependency cycles, and the options for resolving them.
- [stores-container-implementation.md](./stores-container-implementation.md) — the concrete
  Option A plan (table-blind `AppRouter` surface + the stores-cluster renames from the naming
  review §6). The rename mechanics landed (`input`, `RouterStore`, `useRouter`, the `rati/ssr`
  + `rati/debug` entries); this shape change did not.
- [ssg-and-rsc.md](./ssg-and-rsc.md) — SSG (a build script over the shipped `renderApp`) and RSC
  as a compatibility constraint; direction only.
- [dx-and-tooling.md](./dx-and-tooling.md) — test utilities (`rati/testing`), a `dataTrace`
  sibling to `navTrace`, DevTools naming for `Step` components.

## Parked (left as-is — not part of this sort)

- [undecided/](./undecided/) — `deferred-scope-features.md` (`.live()` / `.extend()` / bare-hook
  guard), `dependency-graphs.md` (`derive()`), `ssr-streaming.md`. Weighed, not decided.
- [postponed/](./postponed/) — `rsc-support.md`. Concretized, explicitly deferred.
