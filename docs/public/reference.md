# rati — reference

The complete public API, by entry point. For the concepts and worked examples, start with
the [guide](./guide.md).

| Entry | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `rati` | Everything client-side: scopes, islands, routing, sources, stores. |
| `rati/ssr` | The server-facing surface: hydration, `prepareRoute`. |
| `rati/vite` | The Vite plugin: `vite dev` serves an SSR app, no server of your own. |
| `rati/mobx` | Optional MobX bindings (`observableSource`) and the legacy data layer. |
| `rati/debug` | Opt-in debug tooling (`navTrace`). |

> **Status:** first public iteration. The stores container surface (§Stores) is being
> finalized; names there may still move.

## Scopes

### `scope(inputs)`

Starts a scope from a head of named inputs. Returns a chainable scope value.

```ts
const s = scope({ stationId: input<string>(), limit: input<number>() });
```

### `input<T>()`

Declares one typed input in a scope head. Inputs arrive as the island's props (or a
route's path params) and are diffed by value — a changed input re-resolves the scope.

### `.load(level)`

Adds one resolution level. Keys within a level resolve in parallel; levels resolve in
sequence, and each level's functions receive everything resolved so far
(inputs + all previous levels) as their argument.

Accepted entry shapes:

| Entry | Behavior | Resolved prop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plain value | passed through | the value |
| `(props) => T` / `(props) => Promise<T>` | called once per resolution, result cached per island instance | `T` (awaited) |
| `Promise<T>` | awaited | `T` |
| a class | constructed with the resolved props so far | the instance |
| `Source<T>` or `(props) => Source<T>` | attached on mount, detached on unmount/input change | `T` when ready |
| `hook(fn)` | `fn` runs every render, may call hooks | `fn`'s return; a returned `Source<T>` unwraps to `T` |

A plain function load must not call React hooks (it is cached and would run its hook
once) — use `hook()` for that.

### `.provide(factory, options?)`

Terminal. Replaces what the island provides to its subtree (by default: the resolved
props) with `factory(resolvedProps)`. The value is lifecycle-managed — if it implements
`[Symbol.dispose]`, it is disposed on island teardown, before the sources it was built
over detach. `options.provideTo: Context` additionally publishes the value into an
app-owned React context.

### `hook(fn)`

Marks a load as hook-based: `fn` runs on every render (never cached) and may call any
React hook. Use it for dependency injection (`hook(() => useStores())`) and for adapting
hook-based data libraries. `fn` receives the resolved props so far. A `hook()` load owns
its own subscription lifecycle; rati never attaches or detaches it.

### `data(fn, options?)`

Marks a function load with per-load options — the counterpart of `hook()`: `hook` says how
a load runs, `data` says what it is (a cached data load) and configures it. A bare function
load behaves exactly like `data(fn)` with no options.

```ts
scope().load({
    members: data(({ spaceId }) => api.members.list(spaceId), {
        equals: (a, b) => a.etag === b.etag,   // the refresh gate — see useScopeControls
    }),
});
```

`options.equals(previous, next)` gates `refresh(key)`: an equal re-fetch keeps the old
value (and identity) and stops the downstream cascade. Defaults to deep equality; provide
a cheaper discriminator for large payloads. Types: `DataLoad`, `DataLoadOptions`.

### Scope types

```ts
type Props   = ScopeProps<typeof s>;      // resolved props (Source<T> unwraps to T)
type Inputs  = ScopeInputs<typeof s>;     // the input() head
type Keys    = ScopeLoadKeys<typeof s>;   // load keys (Props minus Inputs) — refresh(key)'s type
type Value   = ScopeProvidesOf<typeof s>; // what useScope(s) returns
const C: ScopeComponent<typeof s> = …;    // component typed to the resolved props
```

Also exported: `Scope`, `ChainableScope`, `Input`, `HookLoad`, `DataLoad`,
`DataLoadOptions`, `ScopeProvideDef`, and the symbols `InputSymbol` / `ScopeSymbol` /
`ScopeDefinitionsSymbol` / `ScopeProvidesSymbol` (advanced: identity checks and
library-level introspection).

---

## Islands

### `island(config)`

Builds a component from a scope. The returned component's props are the scope's inputs.

```ts
island({
    scope,        // required: the Scope value
    component,    // required: ComponentType<ScopeProps<S>>
    loading,      // optional: ComponentType<{ inputs: ScopeInputs<S> }>
    error,        // optional: ComponentType<{ inputs: ScopeInputs<S>; error: SourceError; retry: () => void }>
});
```

- Without `loading`, the island renders nothing while resolving.
- Without `error`, a failure throws to the nearest ErrorBoundary.
- `retry` re-mounts the island's inner tree: fresh promises, fresh sources.
- Types: `IslandComponent<S>`, `IslandConfig<S>`.

### `useScope(scope)` / `useOptionalScope(scope)`

Read what the nearest island built from `scope` provides — the `.provide()` value, or the
resolved props. `useScope` throws outside such an island; `useOptionalScope` returns
`undefined`. Islands built from the same scope share one channel; a reader gets the
nearest one (React context semantics).

### `useScopeControls(scope)`

The nearest island's imperative controls, keyed by the scope like `useScope` (throws
outside the island's subtree):

```ts
const { refresh, pending } = useScopeControls(stationScope);

refresh(): Promise<void>;                      // whole scope — the retry mechanism
refresh(key: ScopeLoadKeys<S>): Promise<void>; // one load, surgically
pending: ReadonlySet<ScopeLoadKeys<S>>;        // keys currently re-fetching
```

`refresh()` with no key re-resolves everything (the loading slot shows again, same as the
error slot's `retry`). `refresh(key)`:

- re-runs that load with the current upstream values; the previous value **stays
  rendered** while the re-fetch is in flight — no loading slot, no blank;
- gates the result: an unchanged value (per the load's `equals` — deep by default, see
  `data()`) keeps the old value and identity and stops there;
- a changed value re-runs exactly the downstream loads whose producers read the key
  (recorded at run time), cascading by the same rules;
- targets **promise loads only** — sources are live and refresh themselves; hook loads run
  every render; static entries have no producer (each warns and no-ops);
- resolves when the key settles (its cascade may still be in flight — watch `pending`);
  a failed re-fetch keeps the previous value, logs, and still resolves.

Type: `ScopeControls<S>`.

---

## Sources

A source is the live-data primitive: an external `pending → ready | error` state machine
that islands read through `useSyncExternalStore`.

```ts
interface Source<T> {
    readonly [SourceSymbol]: true;
    subscribe(onChange: () => void): () => void;
    getSnapshot(): SourceState<T>;    // must be reference-stable while unchanged
    attach(): () => void;             // start the work; returns a detach function
    readonly ssr?: SourceSSR<T>;      // opt-in server resolution — see below
}

type SourceState<T> =
    | { status: 'pending' }
    | { status: 'ready'; value: T }
    | { status: 'error'; error: SourceError };
```

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `readySource(value)` | a source that is already ready |
| `promiseSource(promise, { ssr }?)` | pending until the promise settles |
| `toSource(x)` | lift a value / promise / source (idempotent on sources) |
| `isSource(x)` | type guard |
| `toSourceError(reason)` | map a thrown value to a `SourceError` |
| `NotAvailableError` | throw/reject with it → `error.code === 'not-available'` |
| `SourceError` | `{ code: 'not-available' | 'failed', … }` — switch on `code` in error slots |
| `SourceSSR` | the `ssr` marker type |
| `SourceSymbol` | the brand symbol |

Authoring rules: start the underlying work in `attach()` (not in the constructor), return
its cleanup; keep `getSnapshot()` stable between changes; call the `subscribe` listeners
after each state change.

### SSR-capable sources — the `ssr` marker

By default a source stays pending under SSR (no effects run on the server). The marker
authorizes the server to attach it *during render*, wait for its first settle through
React's own Suspense mechanics, and dehydrate the result. One rule, two shapes:

```ts
type SourceSSR<T> =
    | true                                    // a loader: promise semantics end to end
    | {
          dehydrate?: (value: T) => unknown;  // serialize for the wire (default: the value)
          hydrate: (data: unknown) => void;   // client: seed the store, before attach()
      };
```

- **`ssr: true`** — for loader-shaped sources whose ready value is JSON-safe. Dehydrates
  as a plain value; the client hydrates the key to that value and never creates or
  attaches the source.
- **`ssr: { hydrate, dehydrate? }`** — for live sources that can be seeded. The server
  ships `dehydrate(value)` in the *seeds* payload; the client creates the source as usual
  and calls `hydrate(data)` before attaching, so its first snapshot is already ready —
  no pending gap, no double fetch, fully live afterward.

The marker is a promise of conduct: `attach()` is server-safe and the machine settles in a
reasonable time (a hung source hangs the prerender, same as a hung promise load). Server
resolution engages only under a `HydrationProvider` with a collector — resolving without
dehydration would mismatch on the client.

---

## Routing

### `route(path, name, component, options?)`

Declares one route. `:param` segments become typed params (`/station/:id` →
`{ id: string }`); `*` is the catch-all. The component receives the path params as
props — or, with `options.scope`, the scope's resolved props (checked against the scope,
with the params feeding the scope's inputs).

```ts
route('/station/:stationId', 'station', Board, {
    scope: stationScope,   // optional: data resolved before the component renders
    loading: Skeleton,     // optional: same contract as island's
    error: BoardError,     // optional: same contract as island's
    wrapper: AppLayout,    // optional: layout rendered around the component
});
```

A route can declare itself an internal **redirect** (`RouteRedirect`): the client
router follows it with a history `replace`; on the server `prepareRoute` reports it so
the response is a real 30x before rendering. Targets: `{ name, …params }` (resolved
through the table, current search/hash kept), a literal path string, or
`(params) => target` for legacy param paths. `permanent: true` advises a 301.

```ts
route('/settings', 'settings', () => null, {
    redirect: { to: { name: 'settings-profile' }, permanent: true },
});
```

Routes live in a plain `as const` array. Register its type once for app-wide typed links
and route reads:

```ts
declare module 'rati' {
    interface RatiUserTypes {
        routes: typeof routes;
    }
}
```

### `group(defaults, routes)`

Applies shared `wrapper` / `loading` / `error` to a list of routes (a child's own option
wins). Returns the routes unchanged at the type level — spread the result into the routes
tuple; paths stay absolute.

### `RouterStore`

The router object: owns history, the active route, and navigation. A plain external store
(subscribable; no rendering).

```ts
new RouterStore(routes, options?);

interface RouterStoreOptions {
    history?: History;                                   // default: browser history
    basename?: string;                                   // mount prefix ('/admin'): stripped before matching, prepended to hrefs
    scrollRestoration?: false | ScrollRestorationOptions; // default: scroll-to-top on navigation
    hydratedState?: RouterHydratedState;                 // seed from a server render
}
```

Members:

| Member | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `activeRoute` | the matched route (name, params) or `null` |
| `path` / `state` | current path; per-entry navigation state |
| `navigate(to, options?)` | push. `to`: `{ name, …params }` (typed off the table) or a string |
| `replace(to, options?)` | replace — back skips the current URL |
| `getPath(to)` | build an href from a typed route reference |
| `setSearchParams(params)` | update the query string |
| `subscribe(fn)` | change notification (for non-React consumers) |
| `dispose()` | release history listeners (one router per SSR request — dispose after render) |

`navigate`/`replace` options: `keepCurrentRoute` (change the URL without re-resolving the
mounted route) and `state` (per-entry state, survives back/forward; a same-URL navigation
that changes only state still re-resolves).

### Components & hooks

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<Router />` | renders the active route's component (with its `wrapper`) |
| `<Link to={…} prefetch?>` | typed link; `prefetch` preloads a lazy chunk on hover/touch |
| `<Navigate to={…} />` | declarative redirect on mount |
| `ContextualLink`, `LinkContextProvider`, `useLinkContext` | links resolved against a provided base (nested UI that builds relative links) |
| `useRouter()` | the router, subscribed — reading `activeRoute`/`path` re-renders on navigation |
| `useRouteContext(name)` | what the named route's scope provides, typed off the routes table; accepts only scope-carrying route names |

### History & scroll

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `createBrowserHistory()` | DOM history (default) |
| `createMemoryHistory({ url })` | server / tests |
| `History`, `HistoryLocation`, `HistoryListener`, `HistoryUpdate`, `HistoryAction` | the history contract, for custom hosts |
| `installScrollRestoration(options?)` | standalone installer; usually configured via `RouterStoreOptions.scrollRestoration` |

### `lazy(loader)`

`React.lazy` plus `.preload()`, so the router (and `<Link prefetch>`) can fetch a chunk
before rendering — whether the component is mounted bare or folded into a route. Type:
`PreloadableLazyComponent`.

It also carries a `.moduleId` — which module it imports, as the client manifest keys it.
You never write it: [`rati/vite`](#rativite)'s transform appends it as a second argument
at each call site, so a server render can name the route's chunk (`prepareRoute` surfaces
it; `renderApp` turns it into a `modulepreload`). Without the plugin it is absent, and
`lazy` behaves exactly as it always did.

### Route types

`NameToRoute` (typed `to` objects), `ExtractRouteParams<Path>`, `GenericRouteType`,
`RouteContextValueOf<Name>`, `RouteContextNames`, `RatiUserTypes` (the augmentation
interface).

## Stores

> Being finalized in the current iteration; the shape below is the target surface.

A minimal stores container: construct your stores in one place (the router among them),
provide the container, read it with a typed hook — including inside scope loads via
`hook()`.

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `StoresProvider` | provides the app's stores container |
| `createStoresHook<T>()` | builds the typed `useStores()` hook for your container type |
| `useRouter()` | reads `stores.router` (see Routing) |

The container is app-owned — a plain class whose fields are your stores. rati only needs
`router` to be one of them.

---

## Head

Document metadata that needs **dedupe by depth** — the title and per-page meta. The
deepest live declaration per slot wins (a page beats a layout default); on the client
`HeadProvider` syncs `document.title` and the managed `<meta>` tags on hydration and
every navigation; on the server the winners are read after prerender (`headTags` in
`rati/ssr`, done for you by `renderApp`). Tags that don't need dedupe use native React
19 hoisting or the HTML shell — see the [server rendering guide](./ssr.md#titles-and-meta).

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `createHeadStore(options?)` | one store per rendered tree (per request on the server); options: `defaultTitle`, `titleTemplate(title)` |
| `<HeadProvider store?>` | provides the store + owns the client document sync; `store` may be omitted in a client-only app |
| `<Title>{string}</Title>` | declare the document title (template applies) |
| `useTitle(title)` | hook form; `null`/`undefined` declares nothing |
| `<Meta name="…" content>` / `<Meta property="…" content>` | declare a deduped meta tag (standard / Open Graph) |
| `HeadStore`, `HeadSnapshot`, `MetaTag`, `MetaProps`, `HeadStoreOptions` | the types; `store.snapshot(mode)` exposes the winners for custom sinks |

---

## `rati/ssr`

The server-facing surface. (`HydrationProvider` and `readHydration` run on the client —
mount the provider on both sides so the trees match.) The full flow with code:
[server rendering guide](./ssr.md).

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `renderApp({ url, createApp, assets?, onError? })` | the whole per-request loop: memory history → `createApp` → `prepareRoute` → prerender → dispose. Returns `{ kind: 'rendered', html, status, headTags, stateScript, hydration, errors, matchedCatchAll }` \| `{ kind: 'redirect', to, permanent, status }` \| `{ kind: 'no-match', status }` |
| `RenderAssets` | `{ bootstrapModules?, styleTags?, preloadTagsFor? }` — what the built client needs from the page. Normally `virtual:rati/assets` from [`rati/vite`](#rativite); `bootstrapModules` reaches the prerender, the rest joins `headTags` |
| `renderToHtml(node, { bootstrapModules?, onError? })` | drain `react-dom/static` `prerender` to a string (it awaits Suspense; `renderToString` cannot) |
| `serializeHydration(state)` | the payload as an inert `application/json` script tag (CSP-friendly, placement-free); warns outside production about values that don't survive JSON |
| `readHydration()` | client: parse the embedded payload; `null` → resolve from scratch |
| `headTags(store)` | the head store's winners as escaped HTML — call after prerender |
| `prepareRoute(router)` | drive a memory-history router to its match (preloading a lazy component); returns `{ hydratedState, matchedCatchAll, redirect?, moduleId? }` or `null` when nothing matched |
| `createHydrationCollector()` | `{ collect, collectError, data, seeds, errors }` — records islands' resolved values, live-source seeds, and failed loads during prerender |
| `HydrationProvider` | server: `collect`/`collectError`; client: `data`/`seeds` — islands then hydrate without re-running loads |
| `HydrationState`, `HydrationError`, `Hydration`, `HydrationData`, `PreparedRoute`, `RouterHydratedState`, `HYDRATION_SCRIPT_ID` | the payload/decision types |

Async load results and `ssr: true` sources dehydrate as values; `ssr: { hydrate }` sources
dehydrate as seeds; unmarked sources stay pending under SSR and come alive after hydration
(see [Sources §SSR-capable sources](#ssr-capable-sources--the-ssr-marker)). A load that
*rejects* is recorded in `errors` — statuses derive from it (`not-available` → 404); the
HTML degrades to the loading slot and the client retries the load after hydration.

---

## `rati/vite`

Optional — requires the `vite` peer dependency. Build-time only: it runs in the Vite
process and nothing from this entry reaches the browser. Walkthrough:
[server rendering guide](./ssr.md#the-vite-plugin).

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ratiSsr({ entry?, clientEntry?, template?, placeholders?, outDir? })` | dev: render every request through the app's server entry inside Vite's own dev server — result kinds mapped onto the response, `transformIndexHtml` on the shell (so HMR lives), failures in Vite's error overlay. build: both environments on one `vite build`, plus `virtual:rati/assets` |
| `virtual:rati/assets` (generated) | `{ bootstrapModules, styleTags, preloadTagsFor(moduleId) }` — the built client's tags, inlined into the server bundle so production reads no manifest. Hand it to `renderApp` as `assets`. Types: `/// <reference types="rati/vite/client" />` |

`entry` defaults to `/src/entry-server.tsx`, `clientEntry` to `/src/entry-client.tsx`
(the client build's input — so `index.html` is a shell, not a build input), `template` to
`index.html` (Vite-root relative), `placeholders` to `{ head: '<!--app-head-->', html:
'<!--app-html-->', state: '<!--app-state-->' }`, `outDir` to `{ client: 'dist/client',
server: 'dist/server' }`. A `render` returning a whole `<html>` document is spliced into
rather than filled — no option to set. Anything the app renders with nowhere to go
throws rather than serving a page that silently lost it.

A `lazy()` route's client chunk is preloaded in the page it is rendered on: the plugin
transforms each `lazy()` call site to record the module it imports, and resolves it
through the client manifest. It is additive metadata — `lazy()` behaves identically
without the plugin.

---

## `rati/mobx`

Optional — requires the `mobx` peer dependency; apps that never import this entry keep
MobX out of their bundle.

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `observableSource(getState, attach?, { ssr }?)` | adapt a MobX derivation to a `Source` — the bridge between MobX state and scope loads; `ssr` forwards the [SSR marker](#ssr-capable-sources--the-ssr-marker) |

The remaining exports (`ActiveData`, `ActiveApiData`, `remoteData`, `remoteDataKey`,
`responseKey`) are a legacy data layer pending extraction to its own package; not
recommended for new code.

---

## `rati/debug`

| Export | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `navTrace`, `navTraceStart`, `navTraceEnabled` | navigation-timeline tracing; toggled live via `globalThis.__DEBUG__.nav`, near-zero cost when off |
